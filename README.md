#JCodeModel
JCodeModel is a fork of the existing Sun codemodel, part of the GlassFish project.
With java.net in ruins, it seemed liked a good time to fork this project and
clean it up as well as add some new features (for example, Java 7 syntax).

Many thanks to the original contributors, namely Kohsuke.
